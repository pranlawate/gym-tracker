Phase two Workout Routine

This PDF is designed to act as a supplemental resource for you to refer to while you’re at the gym. This
is NOT a “summary” of the course – meaning that there’s tons of invaluable and essential information
within the course chapters that you need to first go through (progressive overload, exercise tutorial
videos, mind to muscle connection, how heavy to lift, etc.) before applying the workouts contained
within this PDF - otherwise this will be pretty much useless for you to refer to!
With that being said, and as explained in the course, for “Phase 2” your weekly routine will look
something like this:

MONDAY

WEDNESDAY

THURSDAY

FRIDAY

SATURDAY

SUNDAY

Upper 1

Lower 1

Rest

Upper2

Lower 2

Rest

Rest

The exact days don’t matter for your workouts, but the key is to get at least one rest day in between
every 2 consecutive days of working out. And additional rest days can be taken as needed, as long as
you’re still getting in 2 “upper workouts” and 2 “lower workouts” per week.

PHASE two Workouts

upper body WARM UP routine exercise tutorials
3. Band Over-and-Backs

x5

Why

To mobilize the chest/shoulder area and help with shoulder/scapular stability.

How

Hold your band at a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Bring the band over
your head and back behind your body while keeping your arms straight. Keep the
tension even as you move the band behind you (don’t “release the slack” by relaxing
or resting your hands on your back/butt), and then bring it back over your head into
the starting position. If this is too difficult, widen your hand position. When it gets
too easy, narrow your hand position. Avoid arching your back as you perform the
movement by slightly contracting your core.

@jeremyethier

4. Band Pull-Aparts

x10

Why

To warm up the mid-back and rotator cuff musculature to help with your pressing.

How

Hold your band at around shoulder-width apart with an overhand grip. Pull the band
apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Keep your upper traps relaxed as
you do so and focus on feeling your mid-back muscles working. Control back to the
starting position and repeat. You can use just one strand of the band OR a wider grip
to make it easier, then narrow your grip overtime.

Why

To warm up the rotator cuff muscles.

How

Use either a band attached to a pole or a pulley system with the handle set up
at elbow height. Stand beside the cable pulley or band and externally rotate the
shoulder while keeping your elbow at 90 degrees and pinned to the side of your
body. Control back to the starting position and repeat.

corresponding hand. The back leg can be bent with your knee on the ground. Next,
stay in this position and then rotate your torso and lift one arm towards the sky to
try to create a straight line between your arms. Do this for both arms (rotate both
ways) and then come back to the starting position and repeat with the other leg –
this count as 1 rep.

Why

To mobilize the ankles which tends to limit squat depth/mobility in most people.

How

Position yourself in front of a wall with one foot ahead and one foot behind. Lean
your body forward such that your front knee moves towards the wall (it can touch
the wall at the end position). Hold the stretch for 2 seconds, then move back to
the starting position. Ensure the heel of your front foot remains on the ground
throughout each rep. Repeat with both sides.

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 1 E1: Incline Dumbbell Press
STEP 1 (BENCH ANGLE)
Set up an incline bench so that it’s at roughly a 30-degree
angle which seems to be optimal based on the literature
(Lauver et al. 2015). But I would suggest trying out various
angles to see which best activates your upper chest. For
shoulder-dominant pressers, you might even find that a
very low incline of 15 or 20 degree angle activates your
chest better.

STEP 2 (SETUP)
Using your thighs to push the dumbbells up, kick up one
dumbbell at a time so that you can get them into the
starting position. As with the bench press, stick your chest
up towards the ceiling and pinch your shoulder blades
together while depressing your upper traps by bring your
shoulders down and away from your ears). There should
be a slight arch between your lower back and the bench.
You need to maintain this position throughout the lift.

STEP 3 (PRESS)
Press up by thinking about “squeezing your biceps
together” to better activate your chest. Ensure your
shoulder-blades remain retracted and tight. Keep your
elbows slightly tucked as you press, and press up until the
dumbbells almost touch.

STEP 4 (DESCENT)
Slowly lower the weight until the end of the dumbbells
just about touch your chest. Make sure your shoulder
blades are retracted and tight before performing
another rep.

@jeremyethier

19

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 1 E2: Chest Supported Row
This can be done on a T-bar supported row
machine or any other chest-supported variation

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Lie flat on an incline bench with your weighted bar on the
ground. Grab the bar with an overhand thumb-less grip a
little wider than shoulder-width apart.

STEP 2 (PULL)
Pull the bar up towards your “upper abdominal area” as
far as the bench will allow you to go. Focus on squeezing
your shoulder-blades together in order to pull the weight
and try to relax your upper traps as best as possible.
Additional Tips
Your head should remain in a neutral position relative to
your spine, rather than sticking out forward. Your elbows
should make a 90-degree angle when at the top position
to minimize wrist/elbow stress and really think about
pulling with your elbows each rep in order to better
activate your back. They should also remain tucked as
opposed to flared out during each rep.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Control the weight down as opposed to letting it simply
drop. Flex the triceps at the bottom position and then
repeat for more reps.

@jeremyethier

20

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 1 E3: Lean-Away Cable Lateral Raises

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Set the pulley to the lowest position with a handle
attachment. Stand sideways next to the pulley, and then
bring your right foot slightly forward and your left foot
back. Grab the pole with your left hand and grab the
handle with an overhand grip from in between your legs.
Lean towards you right until your left arm is straight, then
maintain this slight lean sideways.

STEP 2 (RAISE)
Raise your right arm out to the side until they reach about
shoulder-height. Think about raising the weight “out”
towards your sides as much as possible opposed to “up”.
Don’t use any momentum to swing the weight up, and try
not to tense your upper traps too much as you raise.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Control the weight on the way down of each rep. Switch
sides and repeat the same protocol.

@jeremyethier

21

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 1 E4: Pull-Ups
STEP 1 (SET UP)
Grab the pull-up bar with an overhand grip slightly wider
than shoulder-width – I’d suggest using a “thumb-less grip”
as it usually helps better activate the back. Next, depress
your upper traps and keep them this way as you pull.

STEP 2 (PULL)
Pull yourself up by pulling your elbows down to the floor,
you want to think about pulling with your elbows as
opposed to pulling with your hands. It’s preferred to keep
your feet straight down throughout the pull-up, but if your
pull-up bar doesn’t allow this then it’s perfectly fine to
cross your feet over and bend your knees.

STEP 3 (TOP POSITION)
You want to pull such that at least your eyes reach over
the bar – and at this point, you want to ensure that your
shoulders are not rounding forward (internally rotating)
and are instead retracted back.

STEP 4 (DESCENT)
Lower your body in a controlled manner until your arms
are straight, and then repeat for another rep. As soon as
you’re able to perform 8 or more bodyweight pull-ups in
one set, I’d suggest adding a little bit of weight by either
using a weight belt or holding a dumbbell between your
feet then continue adding more weight overtime.

upper body 1 E5: Incline Overhead Dumbbell Extensions

STEP 1
Set up an incline bench to around 30 degrees. Lay your
back on the bench with the dumbbells directly overhead.

STEP 2
While keeping your elbows locked, lower the dumbbells
back behind your body as far as it will go.

STEP 3
Press the weight back up to the starting position by using
your triceps while keeping your elbow locked in position.

PHASE two Workouts

lower Body 1 E1: Back Squat
STEP 1 (PLACEMENT)
Grab the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than
shoulder-width. Place the bar on your upper-back (traps)
by dipping under the bar. Raise your chest up and retract
your shoulder blades.

STEP 2 (UNRACK)
Unrack the bar, take 3 steps back, then adjust your
footing. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart or a
little wider. You can point your toes out slightly if this is
more comfortable. But play around with foot positioning
to find what’s comfortable for you.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Take a deep breath in and hold it. You want to use this
breath to brace your core (think about contracting your
abs how you would if someone were to punch your
stomach). Move your hips back while bending your knees
to squat down. Squat down until your thighs are at least
parallel to the ground. If you have the mobility to do so,
then you can go further below parallel.

STEP 4 (ASCENT)
Squat back up by pushing through your heels. Keep your
knees in line with your toes by thinking about “spreading
the floor apart” with your feet. Avoid creeping up on your
toes or collapsing your knees inward. Keep your lower
back neutral and your chest up. You can exhale as you
press up, or keep your breath held and then exhale at the
top position. Then repeat for more reps.

@jeremyethier

25

PHASE two Workouts

lower Body 1 E2: Bulgarian Split Squat

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Grab a dumbbell in each hand and place your back foot
on the top of a bench or any elevated platform. Your front
foot can then be positioned based on what you want to
target. Take a shorter step forward if you want to target
the quads more, or a longer step forward if you want to
target the glutes more.

STEP 2 (DESCENT)
After you get your set up right, bend your front knee until
your thigh is at least parallel with the ground.

STEP 3 (ASCENT)
Push back up through your front foot. Your heel shouldn’t
raise off the floor and you want to keep your head, back,
and hips aligned throughout each rep. Your upper body
can lean forward slightly. Repeat for more reps.
Optional: For those struggling with balance, simply get
rid of the dumbbell in one hand and use that free hand
to hold onto something for balance.

@jeremyethier

PHASE two Workouts

lower Body 1 E3: Swiss Ball Leg Curls

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Lay with your back on the ground with your heels hipwidth apart on a stability ball and your hands placed out
to your sides. Lift your body into the air until your body is
straight and elevated in the air.

STEP 2 (CURL)
While keeping your core tight and body straight, curl the
ball towards your body by bending your knees and lifting
your hips into the air by contracting your hamstrings.
Ensure you aren’t arching your back to compensate, it
should instead remain in a neutral (straight) position.

STEP 3 (RETURN)
Straighten your legs to return the stability back to the
starting position then repeat for another rep. Perform all
reps in a slow and controlled manner and keep your core
and hamstrings engaged throughout each rep.

@jeremyethier

27

PHASE two Workouts

lower Body 1 E4: Single Leg Weighted Calf Raise

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Stand with the toes of one foot on an elevated platform
and a weight held in the opposite hand. Ideally, you should
be holding onto something for balance with your free
hand. Start with your heel touching the floor.

STEP 2 (RAISE)
By using your calves, lift directly straight up on your toes
as high as possible. Pause for half a second at the top
position.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Slowly lower your heel back down to the ground. Pause
for half a second at the bottom position before performing
another rep. If adding weight is too difficult for you,
perform them with just your bodyweight until you gain
the calf strength to add weight.

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 E1: Bench Press
STEP 1 (POSITIONING)
Lie down on the bench so that the bar is sitting directly
over your eyes. Grab the bar with a width such that your
pinky’s just inside the ring marks (but experiment and see
what grip-width works best for you). Raise your chest up
towards the ceiling and squeeze your shoulder-blades
back and down by pinching your shoulder blades together.
Keep your butt on the bench. Bring your feet back under
your knees and plant them firmly on the ground. As a
result, there should be space between your lower back
and the bench (an arch). Squeeze your glutes to help you
maintain a stable position.

STEP 2 (UNRACK)
Straighten your arms to lift the bar up. Move the bar so
that it’s balanced directly over your shoulders.

STEP 3 (DESCEND)
Lower the bar to slightly below your nipples while slightly
tucking your elbows and keeping your forearms vertical
and directly under your wrists. Make sure to use full range
of motion such that the bar physically touches your chest
at the bottom.

STEP 4 (PRESS)
Press the bar from below your nipples to directly above
your shoulders. The bar should not travel straight up
and down, but rather slightly back towards the starting
position. Focus on moving the weight by squeezing your
chest together (think about trying to bring your biceps
together). Your shoulder-blades should be retracted and
pulled down throughout the press, and your butt should
remain in contact with the bench.

@jeremyethier

30

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 E2: seated row
STEP 1 (SETUP)
Grab the “V-bar” attachment and get into your starting
position with your back straight and legs slightly bent.
Depress (relax) your upper traps before pulling by
bringing your shoulders down and away from your ears.

STEP 2 (PULL)
Pull the weight by retracting your shoulder blades and
pulling the V-bar towards your stomach while maintaining
a relatively straight back. Avoid arching or excessively
rounding your back as you pull. Think about pulling with
your elbows as you pull in order to better engage the
back.
The main thing you want to look out for is that as you
pull, you do NOT want your shoulders to roll forward
and internally rotate as this places a lot of stress on
the shoulder joint. Instead, focus on squeezing your
shoulder blades back such that your shoulder doesn’t
roll forward and instead stays pulled back.

STEP 3 (ECCENTRIC)
Control the weight back until your arms are straight and
then repeat for more reps. Avoid using momentum during
each rep.

@jeremyethier

31

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 E3: Standing Overhead Press (Barbell)
STEP 1 (SETUP)
Set up your rack such that the bar is around shoulder
height. Grab the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider
than shoulder-width. The key for grip is to ensure your
wrists are straight and your forearms are vertical when
the bar is in the starting position – so the grip width will
vary based on the individual.

STEP 2 (PREPARING THE PRESS)
Lift the bar off the rack and take a couple steps away
from the rack (keep in mind that normally you’d be
stepping backwards, I just had to unrack it forwards in
order to show you the positioning). Engage your core by
contracting your abs slightly (think about as if someone
was about to punch your stomach) and squeeze your
glutes.

STEP 3 (PRESS)
Take a deep breath in, hold it, and then press the bar up.
You’ll have to ensure your head is not sticking forward
in order to do so. Once the bar passes the top of your
head, you can move your head forward (“look through the
window”) to allow the bar to be directly over your head in
the finishing position. Don’t use momentum with your legs
as you and make sure that you aren’t arching your lower
back when pressing. A little bit of an arch is fine as long
as it’s not excessive, just make sure that your core still
remains tight and engaged.

STEP 4 (DESCEND)
Bring the bar to your shoulders after each rep while
exhaling your breath.

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 superset 1/2: Kneeling Face Pulls

STEP 1 (SET UP)
Set up a cable system so that the notch is a couple notches
below from the very top. Grab the rope with an overhand
grip, then get down on one knee. Relax your upper traps
by bringing your shoulders down and away from your ears.
You want to maintain this throughout each rep.

STEP 2 (PULL)
Pull the rope towards your face while keeping your elbows
high. Think about pulling with your elbows and squeezing
your shoulder-blades together, and as you pull, you want
to externally rotate your shoulder such that your knuckles
are facing the ceiling.

STEP 2 (PULL)
You can see what I mean here at this angle, the end
position is as if you were holding a “biceps flexing pose”.
This helps further target the rotator cuff.

STEP 3 (ECCENTRIC)
Control the weight back to the starting position and then
repeat for another rep. Ensure that you aren’t excessively
arching or rounding your back during each rep. You should
feel a strong contraction in the middle of your back.

@jeremyethier

33

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 superset 2/2: High to Low Cable Flies

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Set the cables up so that they’re above shoulder-height.
I’d suggest setting them so that they’re as high as
possible. Grab both handles with an overhand grip and
take a step forward to split your stance. Stick your chest
out and relax your traps by bringing your shoulders down
and away from your ears.

STEP 2 (PRESS)
While maintaining a slight bend in the elbows, press
the handles forward and down by squeezing your chest
together – think about trying to touch your biceps
together as opposed to pressing the weight. At the
bottom position, cross your hands over eachother to get
a better contraction. At this point the handles should be
around the height of your belly-button and slightly in
front of your body.

STEP 3 (ECCENTRIC)
Control the weight back to the starting position and then
repeat the movement. If during the previous rep your
right hand crossed over your left, do the opposite for the
next rep and keep alternating. Your elbows should stay in
the same locked position throughout the movement, all
the movement should come from the shoulder joint and
NOT from your elbows.

@jeremyethier

34

PHASE two Workouts

upper body 2 E5: Incline Dumbbell Curls

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Set up an incline bench to around 30 degrees (a similar
angle as you’d use for incline presses). Grab two
dumbbells and lay with your back on the bench and your
arms hanging straight by your sides. Your head can lay flat
on the bench if comfortable.

STEP 2 (CURL)
While keeping your elbows locked in position, curl both
dumbbells up towards your shoulders. Your elbows
should remain locked and should not move (a little
movement is acceptable) throughout the curl. Ensure that
your upper traps don’t tighten up (elevate) as you curl the
weight up. Keep them relaxed as much as possible.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Lower the weights back to the starting position (arms
fully almost fully extended) in a controlled manner, while
keeping your elbows locked in the same position.

PHASE two Workouts

lower body 2 E1: Deadlift (conventional)
STEP 1 (SETUP)
Stand with your mid-foot under the bar when looking
down. Your feet should be about hip-width apart (or
slightly wider) and toes can be slightly pointed out. The
stance is a little narrower than that of the squat. Bend
over at the hips and grab the bar with an overhand grip
that is about shoulder-width apart or just outside of your
shins. Your arms should be straight.

STEP 2 (STARTING POSITION)
Drop into the starting position by bending your knees
and lifting your chest until your back is straight. The bar
should be as close to your shins as possible and should still
be over your mid-foot. This is your starting position – with
your head in line with your back and hips and your lower
back straight. Also note that your butt should be between
your knees and head, rather than too low or too high.

STEP 3 (PULL)
Take a deep breath in and hold this breath. You want to
use this breath to brace your core (think about contracting
your abs how you would if someone were to punch your
stomach). Pull slightly until you feel tension with the bar,
then pull the weight off the floor by straightening your
legs and pushing your hips forward simultaneously. Keep
the bar as close as possible to your legs as you pull up – the
bar should travel in a vertical path. Don’t round your back
as you pull. Breathe out at the top.

STEP 4 (DESCENT)
Return the weight to the floor by first bending at the hips
and then by bending the knees. Again, the bar should be as
close to the legs as possible. I’d suggest letting the weight
come to a dead stop on the floor and then readjusting
your form before your next rep. Once you get better
at the deadlift, you can perform your reps in more of a
continuous fashion (e.g. “touch and go”).

lower body 2 E2: leg press
I would advise using the “decline” leg press machine as
shown below if you have access to it at your gym, since
it provides a more effective range of motion and better
weight loading. Although I’ll be using a standard leg press
machine in the below instruction pictures, the same steps/
tips apply to any leg press variation/machine.

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Place your feet shoulder-width apart with your toes
pointed either straight or slightly pointed outwards. Your
feet should be positioned in the middle of the foot plate.

STEP 2 (PUSH)
By pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using
your quadriceps, push the weight until your legs are
almost fully extended – but DO NOT lock out your knees.
They should be slightly bent at the end position. If using
the decline leg press, this step will instead require you to
unhook the safety bars and then lower the weight into
the bottom position before pressing with the above tips.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. But
at the bottom position, ensure that your lower back is not
rising off the back rest. You want to descend until you
reach just before the point that your lower back starts to
come off the back rest – as this indicates your end range
of motion.

lower body 2 E3: Reverse Lunges

STEP 1 (SETUP)
Stand straight with either dumbbells held by your side or
with a weighted bar on your back.

STEP 2 (DESCENT)
Move one foot back and place the toes of that foot on
the ground behind you. Bend your front leg to lower your
body until your back knee just about touches the ground.
Your shin should be near-vertical at the bottom position.

STEP 3 (ASCENT)
By pushing up with the heel of your front foot, raise your
body back up to the starting position. Your back should
remain straight throughout the process.

STEP 4
Repeat with the other leg.

lower body 2 E4: Seated Weighted Calf Raise

Ideally you want to perform
these on a seated calf raise
machine. But if unable to do
so, use the following tips. But
the same general guidelines
apply for whichever seated
calf raise variation you
perform.

STEP 1 (SETUP)
If you don’t have access to aseated calf raise machine,
sit on a bench with two dumbbells placed on your thighs
and your toes elevated on weight plates or any elevated
platform. Your heels should be touching the ground.

STEP 2 (RAISE)
Raise both toes straight up as high as possible while
keeping the dumbbells on your thighs. Hold this top
position for half a second.

STEP 3 (DESCENT)
Lower your heels until they touch the ground, pause for
half a second, then repeat for another rep.
